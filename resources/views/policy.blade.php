<span style=''>Other Information Collected</span><br>
<span style=''>Some information may be collected automatically
every time you visit Mmozone web sites, such as cookies and computer
information. In addition, information may be collected from other independent,
third-party sources. We also collect information about which pages you visit
within Mmozone. Mmozone visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></span></p>

<span style=''>Cookies</span><br>
<span style=''>Mmozone uses both session ID cookies and
persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an
alphanumeric identifier (a file) that Mmozone web sites transfer to your
computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize
your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you
close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an
extended period of time.</span><br>
<span style=''>We use session ID cookies to make it easier for
you to navigate Mmozone. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which
sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent cookies
in areas of its web site where you must register, and where you are able to
customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your
preferences more than once.</span><br>
<span style=''>By configuring the options in your browser, you
may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline
the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on Mmozone and
you may be required to re-enter the information required to complete an order
during new or interrupted browser sessions.</span><br>
<span style=''>Some of Mmozone business partners (e.g.,
advertisers) use cookies on the site. We have no access or control over these
cookies (see &quot;Third Party Advertising&quot; and &quot;Third Party
Cookies&quot; below). Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of
cookies by Mmozone only and does not cover the use of cookies by any
advertisers.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></span></p>

<span style=''>Log Files</span><br>
<span style=''>As is true of most web sites, Mmozone gathers
certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information
includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date / time stamp, and
click stream data. Mmozone uses this information to analyze trends, to screen
for fraud, to administer Mmozone sites, to track users' movements around the
web sites and to gather demographic information about Mmozone user base as a
whole.</span><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
